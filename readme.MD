# Express API

This is a simple Rest API created using Express and SQLite to help those learning front-end technologies such as:
 - Vue, 
 - React
 - Angular

## Usage

1. Make sure you have `Node` installed. (It was created using `v14.16.0`)
2. Clone the repository
3. Open a terminal or CMD
  - Navigate to the root folder
  - Type `npm run server` and voilà!


## Notes
### About dependecies
- `nodemon` watches for changes to avoid having to reset the server if there are changes.
- `bcrypt` hashes the passwords.
- `sqlite` for persistency.
- `jsonwebtoken` let us practice authentication

## About the project
- There are validations missing**
- It needs documentation (e.i. Swagger)
